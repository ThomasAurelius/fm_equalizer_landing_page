## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The colors don't match from the preview files to the assets! The orange in the assets is lighter, than it is in the preview. I used color capture to copy it from the bg-icon-1.
